## Repository Management

### GitHub Project Board

The project uses a Kanban-style board with the following columns:
- **Backlog**: All newly created issues
- **To Do**: Issues that are ready to be worked on and have been assigned
- **In Progress**: Issues that are actively being worked on (linked to PRs)
- **Review**: Pull requests that are ready for review
- **Done**: Completed issues and merged PRs

### Branch Management

- **main**: Production-ready code, protected branch
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/\***: New features or enhancements
- **bugfix/\***: Bug fixes
- **release/\***: Release preparation
- **hotfix/\***: Urgent fixes for production

### Issue Triage

Process for handling new issues:
1. Review new issues within 48 hours
2. Apply appropriate labels (bug, enhancement, documentation, etc.)
3. Assess priority and assign to milestone if applicable
4. Request additional information if needed
5. Add to project board (automatically goes to Backlog)

## Code Review Process

### Pull Request Standards

Every PR should:
- Reference an issue (except for minor documentation updates)
- Include tests that cover the changes
- Pass all CI checks
- Include updated documentation if applicable
- Follow the project's code style

### Review Checklist

When reviewing PRs:
1. Verify CI checks have passed
2. Check code quality and style
3. Ensure adequate test coverage
4. Verify documentation updates
5. Check for security implications
6. Test functionality if possible

### Providing Feedback

- Be constructive and specific
- Differentiate between blocking issues and suggestions
- Explain reasoning behind requested changes
- Acknowledge good practices and improvements
- Use GitHub's review functionality (Comments, Approve, Request changes)

### Merging Strategy

1. Require at least one approving review
2. Ensure all discussions are resolved
3. Verify CI checks pass
4. Use squash merging for feature branches to keep history clean
5. Delete branches after merging

## Release Management

### Versioning

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backwards compatible)

### Release Planning

1. Group related changes into a release
2. Create milestone to track progress
3. Assign issues to the milestone
4. Communicate timeline to contributors and users

### Release Process

1. **Preparation**:
    - Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes
    - Create a release branch `release/vX.Y.Z`
    - Update version numbers in:
        - pom.xml
        - README.md
        - Other relevant files

2. **Testing**:
    - Verify all tests pass
    - Perform integration testing
    - Deploy to staging environment if applicable

3. **Finalization**:
    - Merge release branch to main branch
    - Tag the release with version number
    - Create GitHub release with release notes
    - Update documentation if necessary

4. **Announcement**:
    - Post in GitHub Discussions
    - Update project website if applicable
    - Share on relevant platforms/forums

### Hotfix Process

For critical issues in production:
1. Create a `hotfix/vX.Y.Z` branch from the tagged release
2. Fix the issue with minimal changes
3. Follow abbreviated release process
4. Merge the fix back to develop branch as well

## Community Management

### Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: General questions and community discussions
- **Pull Requests**: Code contributions and reviews
- **External Channels**: Consider Discord, Slack, or mailing list for real-time discussions

### Discussion Categories

Maintain the following discussion categories:
- **Announcements**: Official project announcements
- **Ideas**: Feature suggestions and brainstorming
- **Q&A**: Questions and answers about usage
- **General**: General discussions about the project
- **Development**: Development-related discussions

### Response Guidelines

- Acknowledge new issues and PRs within 48 hours
- Be respectful and professional in all communications
- Apply the Code of Conduct consistently
- Regularly check and respond to discussions
- Thank contributors for their involvement

### Handling Difficult Situations

- Address Code of Conduct violations promptly and directly
- De-escalate conflicts by focusing on technical aspects
- Take discussions private if they become heated
- Document decisions and reasoning
- Be prepared to close unproductive discussions

## Security Management

### Vulnerability Handling

When security issues are reported:
1. Acknowledge receipt privately
2. Assess severity and impact
3. Develop and test fixes privately
4. Coordinate disclosure timeline
5. Issue security advisory through GitHub
6. Release patched version
7. Credit reporter (if they wish to be credited)

### Dependency Management

- Monitor Dependabot alerts
- Regularly review and update dependencies
- Prioritize security-related updates
- Test thoroughly after dependency updates

### Security Scanning

- Use automated security scanning tools
- Address critical and high vulnerabilities promptly
