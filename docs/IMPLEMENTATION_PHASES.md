# Implementation Phases

This document outlines the complete implementation plan to make the distributed storage system production-ready and fully functional.

## Phase 1: Core Storage Node Implementation
- Create storage node Spring Boot application
- Implement file storage endpoints (upload, download, delete, exists)
- Add basic health check endpoints
- Create Docker configuration for storage nodes
- Update docker-compose.yml to properly build storage nodes

## Phase 2: File Metadata Persistence
- Create FileMetadata entity for tracking file locations
- Add database tables for file-to-node mapping
- Update LoadBalancerService to use persistent file mapping
- Implement file location caching with database fallback

## Phase 3: Enhanced Node Management
- Implement node registration and heartbeat mechanisms
- Add automatic node discovery and health monitoring
- Create node failure detection and recovery
- Implement graceful node shutdown and startup

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Test Suite
- Add unit tests for all service classes
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Create test containers for database testing
- Add end-to-end tests for file operations

## Phase 5: Authentication and Security
- Implement proper JWT-based authentication
- Add role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure inter-service communication
- Add request validation and sanitization

## Phase 6: File Redundancy and Replication
- Implement configurable file replication across nodes
- Add data consistency checks and repair mechanisms
- Create backup and recovery strategies
- Implement RAID-like protection options

## Phase 7: Advanced Load Balancing
- Enhance load balancing strategies with real-time metrics
- Add capacity-aware routing
- Implement geographic load balancing
- Add circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance

## Phase 8: Monitoring and Observability
- Enhance metrics collection and dashboards
- Add distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Implement alerting and notification systems
- Create performance monitoring and profiling

## Phase 9: API Enhancements
- Implement file versioning system
- Add bulk operations (upload/download multiple files)
- Create file metadata enrichment (tags, categories)
- Add search and filtering capabilities

## Phase 10: Performance Optimization
- Implement caching layers (Redis)
- Add compression for file transfers
- Optimize database queries and indexing
- Implement connection pooling and resource management

## Phase 11: Deployment and Infrastructure
- Create Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Implement auto-scaling configurations
- Add configuration management (ConfigMaps, Secrets)
- Create deployment scripts and automation

## Phase 12: CI/CD Pipeline
- Set up GitHub Actions workflows
- Implement automated testing pipeline
- Add code quality checks (SonarQube, SpotBugs)
- Create automated deployment strategies

## Phase 13: Documentation and Developer Experience
- Complete API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Create developer setup guides
- Add troubleshooting documentation
- Implement SDK/client libraries

## Phase 14: Production Hardening
- Add comprehensive error handling and logging
- Implement rate limiting and throttling
- Add data encryption at rest and in transit
- Create disaster recovery procedures

## Phase 15: Final Integration and Testing
- Conduct comprehensive system testing
- Performance and load testing
- Security penetration testing
- Final production readiness review

Each phase builds upon the previous ones, ensuring a stable and incremental development process that maintains system functionality throughout the implementation.
